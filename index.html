            <p>Child mortality is the mortality of children under the age of five measured per 1000 live births. Child mortality has steadily decreased in most parts of the world, however, in 2050 some nations will still have a long way to go.</p>

            <h2>What is the history of child mortality in the world?</h2>
            <p>In 1950, every country in the data had a mortality rate greater than zero. Mortality rates were low in the western world, but were high in the continents of Asia, Africa and the Americas. Oman reported the highest mortality of 475 deaths per
                1000 children, although, this was later eclipsed by a mortality rate of 582 per 1000 in China in 1960.

                    <p>From 1958 to 1962, China suffered from a major famine and multiple natural disasters under Mao. This resulted in the deaths of tens of millions of people. At the same time, mortality rates climbed to the highest in the data for 1960.
                        This reveals how issues with government and planned economies can lead to poverty and famine. Therefore, severely impacting child mortality over a very short period of time.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="text-margin">
            <p>By 2000, mortality rates had dropped significantly due to advances in modern medicine, now widely available throughout the world. Mortality rates in Australia, New Zealand and most of Western Europe would soon drop below zero while China had
                made great improvement to become the global median at 36 deaths per 1000.</p>
            <p>Looking toward the future, our regression predictions show South America and the Middle East quickly dropping to zero. Most places in the world follow over the next few decades although child mortality remains high in Africa. Particularly
                in central and west African nations.</p>
        </div>


        <div class="text-margin">
            <h2>Why Isn't Child Mortality uniform?</h2>
            <p>According to the world health organisation, the leading causes of death for children under the age of 5 is infectious disease. Malnourishment are at even greater risk of death from ilness during childhood, with "Nutrition-related factors contribute
                to about 45% of</strong> deaths in children under-5 years of age."
            </p>
            <p>For these reasons, the WHO has instigated <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/children-reducing-mortality">Sustainable
                    Development Goal 3.2.1</a> to reduce mortality below 12 deaths by 1000 live births in every country and deaths under the age of 5 to less than 25 per 1000 <strong>2030</strong>. Unfortunately, our simple regression predictions show
                that with the current rate of improvement this is far from possible. A significantly larger intervention will be required to reach this target.</p>

            <p>By 2050, this target will be somewhat in reach, if Somalia and the Central African Republic are excluded.

            <h2>How are disease, nutrition and child mortality related?</h2>
            <p>This chart shoes very clearly that on average, as the portion of under-nourished people in a nation increases, so does the number of years of unhealthly life (either lived or lost from premature death). In addition, as either of these factors
                scale, mortality rates in each country also grows proportionally.
            </p>
            <p>This reveals that countries with high rates of infectious disease and malnutrition are much more likely to have moderate to severe rates of child mortality. On the other hand, developed countries with ubiquitous access to food, vaccines and
                medical care are much more likely to have low child mortality rates.
            </p>
            <p>This does not mean that child mortality is not affected by other factors. Research shows in Africa, armed conflicts 100km away can increase infant mortality 2-4 fold for 8 years after a conflict. The Australian government also states that
                homicide can be a leading cause of child deaths. In Australia, 0.8 per 100 000 children die due to violence-related causes (Four times greater than Spain, Greece and Italy).</p>
            <p>Many people believe country size and population is linked to child mortality. This will be explored this in the following section.</p>

            <h2>A more subtle relationship...</h2>
            <p>In the above chart on the left, it is clear that there are clusters where child mortality is higher in certain parts of the world and completely almost non existant in others. I it is important to note that this is not shown by negative space
                on the chart as this can also represent the absense of a country entirely (the ocean). The vast majority of countries with the highest mortality rates are close to the equator, typically falling between -25 to 50 degrees longitude. Except
                for the Middle East, mortality mostly falls off beyond 20 and -70 degrees latitude.</p>
            <p>In the second chart, we can observe that population only increases somewhat with a nation's landmass. By dragging a box to focus on the main cluster, it is clear that there are many countries that are huge, but the populaltion size is not
                stronly correlated. This is the same for mortality rates because countries with high and low mortality rates can be seen throughout the range of population and land size. China for example is huge and has a massive population but a very
                small mortality rate in 2017.

                a lot (between 120-300 deaths per 1000).</p>
            <p> In this chart it is also clear to see that the high mortality countries have become closer to each other. This could be due to receiving better aid from the rest of the world, better access to low cost and highly availible available or improving
                regional economies. Unfortunately there is a great divide between these best and worst off countries seperating the privileged from the non-privelaged children arround the world.</p>

            <h2>Predictions on contributing factors</h2>
            <p>In the above charts, we have used historical data of some high child mortality countries to see how they are doing in improving population nutrition and decreasing burden of disease.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, many countries were missing from these data sets such as the Central African Republic, Somalia, Democratic Republic of Congo. With the available data we can see that Angola and Chad are in fact improving their nutrition in the
                population. However, Chad is doing relatively little to improve nutrition in the population. According to the UN World Food Program, Chad has "one of the highest levels of hunger in the world," worsened by climate and conflict. 2.2 million
                people are malnourished, 43% of children under 5 are stunted and 3.7 million people are food insecure.
                <a href="https://www.wfp.org/countries/chad">(Source)</a>
            </p>
            <p>Fortunately, the burden of disease is increasing in these countries, which suggest some hope for countries whose child mortality is a product of infectious disease rather than malnourishment. However, the road will not by any means be easy.
                Greater international intervention will be needed in order to reduce the factors that are contributing to mortality rates in underdeveloped and conflicted nations.

            <p> In no world should millions of children die because of where they are born. It is therefore my wish that the reader considers this on their next trip to the doctor or out to eat, for we are very lucky to live such easy and privileged existence.</p>
